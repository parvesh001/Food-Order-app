# Food Order App

## This is one of the outputs of React course that i am pursuing. This is a sort of demo food order app that includes interective UIs made-up with the help of React.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- REACT
- BOOTSTRAP
- CSS MODULES

## Used Hooks
- **USESTATE HOOK** : Very useful to make website user interective. Without useState one can't perceive to make interective and dynamic UIs. It accepts a initial state which can be changed with conditions (e.g. if button has been clicked or some kind of data has been entered).

- **USEREDUCER HOOK**: Although its tak is similar to useState hook, yet it is more powerful and is used to handle complex states, states which are dependent on other states to be changed.

- **USEEFFECT HOOK**: This hook is utilized to handle side-effects (sending http requests to server or storing data into local storage or conditions) which have directly nothing to do with bringing something on screen. With the help of this, we can evade unwanted errors and bugs.

- **USECONTEXT HOOK**: Handle React APIs. useful for sharing data anywhere in app without making cumbersome references through the chain of props.

- **USEREF**: This hook ensures access to DOM elements. Returns an object with property 'current' which has reference to targeted DOM element.

- **CUSTOME HOOK**: Custome hooks are very useful tools which makes things easier and faster. With custome hooks we can reutilize functionality defined in custome hook. They are like inbuilt hooks, but the difference is that developers fabricate these hooks to their own project.

## API and FETCH
In this project, React APIs have been utilized to get rid of the long cyncle of sharing data through parents. Besides, the 'fetch' method has been utilized to fetch data from a backend server handled by **firebase**.
